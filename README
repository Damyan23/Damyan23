Hi I am an aspiring game programmer/developer who is passionate about creating immersive and engaging gaming experiences, and I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow my skills in game and development. 
I always am striving to write clean and  and efficient code. Having plenty of first hand experience with working in a team, I have grown to be an enthusiastic, hard-working team member, who's passion is the development 
of story and gameplay driven games! 

I started my game development journey buck in 2020 with my first ever game development course. Since then I have worked on several personal and team projects. 
2023 I enrolled in Saxion Univeristy of Applied Sciences with a bachellor of Creative Media and Game Technologies.
