I am an aspiring game programmer/developer passionate about creating immersive and engaging gaming experiences. I am always eager to learn and enhance my skills in game development, striving to write clean and efficient code. With substantial experience working in teams, I am an enthusiastic, hard-working team player dedicated to developing story-driven and gameplay-focused games.

My journey in game development began in 2020 with my first game development course. Since then, I have worked on several personal and team projects, continuously honing my skills. In 2023, I enrolled in the Saxion University of Applied Sciences, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Creative Media and Game Technologies. Over the years, I have gained valuable experience in critical thinking and problem-solving, which I apply to my programming projects.
